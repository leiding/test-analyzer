# TestAnalyzer

Test analyzer is a tool which help QE to design test case.
You may heared about design patterns, there are similar concepts in test case design. The main goal of this tool is help QE understand the software to be tested in the following three aspect
1>What we tested?
2>Is the test enough?
3>Is there anything missing?

Also this tool will help QE to generate detailed test cases. I found this will be very useful because writing detailed test cases has lots of duplicated works which could/should do by programer.

The archteture
1>The backend will use phoenix which is a new web develop frameworked based on elixir language
2>The front-end will use vue.js

Develop roadmap:
v0.1
1.Add property, components and generate test table
